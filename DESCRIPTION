Description: Provides a complete workflow for the identification, analysis, and functional
    annotation of long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) from RNA-Seq data. The package
    includes functions for filtering transcripts from GTF files, evaluating the
    performance of multiple coding potential prediction tools (e.g., CPC2, PLEK,
    CPAT), and summarizing their agreement. It enables systematic performance
    analysis of individual tools, "at least N" tool consensus, and all possible tool
    combinations. Functional analysis is supported through the identification of
    potential cis- and trans-acting interactions with protein-coding genes,
    followed by enrichment analysis. Results can be visualized using a variety
    of plots, including radar plots, clock plots, and interactive Sankey diagrams.

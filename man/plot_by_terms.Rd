\arguments{
\item{data}{data.frame. A data frame containing combined output from trans/cis_interactions functions.
This data frame must include at least the following columns:
\code{term_name} (functional term name from gProfiler),
\code{intersection} (e.g., genomic region or gene intersection),
\code{lncRNA.id} (lncRNA identifier),
\code{type} (interaction type, e.g., "trans", "cis"),
and optionally \code{source} (data source identifier).}

\item{select_terms}{character vector, optional. A vector of term names from the \code{term_name} column of the input \code{data}
to be highlighted or exclusively plotted. If \code{NULL} (default), the function will prompt the user to interactively select terms.}

\item{label}{logical, optional. If \code{TRUE}, node labels (term names, intersection IDs, lncRNA IDs) are displayed on the Sankey diagram nodes.
If \code{FALSE} (default), no labels are shown.}

\item{color}{character, optional. A single color name (e.g., "blue", "steelblue") to manually apply to all nodes and links in the diagram.
If \code{NULL} (default), a random color palette is generated for nodes, and links inherit colors from their target nodes.}

\item{title}{character, optional. The title of the Sankey diagram. If \code{NULL} (default), no title is displayed.}

\item{color_selected}{logical, optional. Used in conjunction with \code{select_terms}.
If \code{TRUE}, all interactions from the input \code{data} are plotted, but only nodes and links associated with the \code{select_terms}
are colored according to the \code{color} parameter (or default palette). Nodes and links not associated with \code{select_terms} are colored gray.
If \code{FALSE} (default), only interactions directly involving the \code{select_terms} are plotted, and coloring applies to these selected elements.
Cannot be \code{TRUE} if \code{select_terms = NULL}.}

\description{
Creates a Sankey diagram visualizing the connections of nodes to selected terms from a gProfiler output table.
This function is designed to display relationships between lncRNAs, intersection (e.g., genomic regions),
and functional terms (like GO terms or pathways) obtained from gProfiler analyses.

# Assuming 'combined_table' is your data frame containing gProfiler interaction results
# (replace 'combined_table' with your actual data frame name)

# Example 1: Basic Sankey diagram plotting all terms with interactive selection
# fig1 <- plot_by_terms(data = combined_table)
# fig1 # Display the plot

# Example 2: Plotting only interactions for specific terms (e.g., "response to stress")
# fig2 <- plot_by_terms(data = combined_table, select_terms = "response to stress")
# fig2 # Display the plot

# Example 3: Plotting interactions for multiple selected terms
# fig3 <- plot_by_terms(data = combined_table, select_terms = c("response to stress", "apoptotic process"))
# fig3 # Display the plot

# Example 4: Sankey diagram with node labels enabled
# fig4 <- plot_by_terms(data = combined_table, label = TRUE)
# fig4 # Display the plot

# Example 5: Sankey diagram with a custom title
# fig5 <- plot_by_terms(data = combined_table, title = "Sankey Diagram of Term Interactions")
# fig5 # Display the plot

# Example 6: Sankey diagram with a single color for all elements (e.g., "skyblue")
# fig6 <- plot_by_terms(data = combined_table, color = "skyblue")
# fig6 # Display the plot

# Example 7: Highlighting interactions related to "response to stress" term, while showing all data
# fig7 <- plot_by_terms(data = combined_table, select_terms = "response to stress", color_selected = TRUE)
# fig7 # Display the plot

# Example 8: Highlighting with a custom color for selected terms
# fig8 <- plot_by_terms(data = combined_table, select_terms = "response to stress", color_selected = TRUE, color = "forestgreen")
# fig8 # Display the plot

# Example 9: Interactive term selection from console
# fig9 <- plot_by_terms(data = combined_table, select_terms = NULL)

\title{Prepare Data Sets for Performance Evaluation}
\usage{
prepareEvaluationSets(codPotList, ncTest, cdsTest)
}
\arguments{
\item{codPotList}{A list object, typically from \code{aggregateCodPot()}. Must
contain \verb{$seqIDs} (character vector) and \verb{$tools} (a list of
numeric vectors).}

\item{ncTest}{A character vector of sequence IDs known to be non-coding.}

\item{cdsTest}{A character vector of sequence IDs known to be protein-coding.}
}
\value{
A list containing elements filtered to include only sequences from
\code{ncTest} or \code{cdsTest}:
\item{seqIDs}{Filtered character vector of sequence IDs.}
\item{tools}{Filtered list of tool prediction vectors.}
\item{type}{Character vector with annotation ("nc" or "cds").}
\item{isNC}{Integer vector: 1 if type is "nc", 0 if "cds".}
\item{sums}{Integer vector with the sum of predictions across all tools.}
}
\description{
Filters coding potential results to include only sequences present in
provided test sets. It annotates each sequence as non-coding (nc) or
protein-coding (cds), creating a summary object ready for various evaluation
functions (e.g., \code{BestTool}, \code{BestToolAtleast}).
}
\examples{
# --- 1. Create mock data mimicking package outputs ---
# a) Output from aggregateCodPot()
mockCodPotList <- list(
  seqIDs = c("nc_seq1", "cds_seq1", "nc_seq2", "other_seq"),
  tools = list(
    CPC2 = c(1, 0, 1, 1),
    PLEK = c(1, 1, 0, 0)
  )
)

# b) Outputs from createTrainTestSets()
mockNcSets <- list(
  nc.train = c("nc_seq3", "nc_seq4"),
  nc.test = c("nc_seq1", "nc_seq2")
)
mockCdsSets <- list(
  cds.train = c("cds_seq2"),
  cds.test = c("cds_seq1")
)

# --- 2. Run the function to prepare the evaluation set ---
evaluationSummary <- prepareEvaluationSets(
  codPotList = mockCodPotList,
  ncTest = mockNcSets$nc.test,
  cdsTest = mockCdsSets$cds.test
)

# --- 3. Inspect the prepared data ---
# Note: "other_seq" was filtered out as it was not in the test sets.
print(evaluationSummary)

\title{Split a Set of Sequence Names into Training and Test Sets}
\usage{
createTrainTestSets(sequences, percentTrain = 0.6, prefix = "set")
}
\arguments{
\item{sequences}{A character vector of sequence names, or an object with a
\code{names} attribute (like the list returned by \code{seqinr::read.fasta}).}

\item{percentTrain}{A numeric value between 0 and 1 indicating the proportion
of sequences to allocate to the training set (default: 0.6).}

\item{prefix}{A character string used as a prefix for the names of the
elements in the returned list (default: "set"). For example, \code{prefix = "cds"}
will result in list elements named "cds.train" and "cds.test".}
}
\value{
A list containing two character vectors. The names of the list
elements are constructed using the \code{prefix} argument (e.g., \code{cds.train}
and \code{cds.test}).
}
\description{
This function partitions a vector of sequence names into training and testing
subsets based on a specified percentage. It uses random sampling, so for
reproducible splits, set a seed with \code{set.seed()} before calling it.
This single function replaces the previous, separate \code{test.train.cds} and
\code{test.train.nc} functions.

\examples{
# --- Example 1: Splitting CDS sequences (replaces test.train.cds) ---
all_cds_names <- paste0("cds_seq_", 1:200)
set.seed(123) # for a reproducible split
cds_split <- createTrainTestSets(
  sequences = all_cds_names,
  percentTrain = 0.7,
  prefix = "cds"
)
names(cds_split)
length(cds_split$cds.train)
length(cds_split$cds.test)

# --- Example 2: Splitting non-coding sequences (replaces test.train.nc) ---
# Input can also be a list with names
nc_fasta_like <- as.list(paste0("nc_seq_", 1:100))
names(nc_fasta_like) <- paste0("nc_seq_", 1:100)
set.seed(456)
nc_split <- createTrainTestSets(
  sequences = nc_fasta_like,
  percentTrain = 0.5,
  prefix = "nc"
)
names(nc_split)
length(nc_split$nc.train)
length(nc_split$nc.test)

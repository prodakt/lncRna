\title{Create Clock Plots for Confusion Matrix Metrics}
\usage{
clock_plot_cm(
  cm_list,
  methods = NULL,
  metrics = c("Accuracy", "Sensitivity", "Specificity", "Precision", "Recall"),
  plot_title = "Clock Plot of Metrics",
  colors = NULL,
  layout = "single",
  ...
)
}
\arguments{
\item{cm_list}{list. A named list of confusion matrix objects, typically created using \code{caret::confusionMatrix}.
Names of the list elements should correspond to the method names.}

\item{methods}{character vector, optional. A vector of method names to include in the plot.
If NULL, the function will prompt the user to interactively select methods from \code{cm_list}.}

\item{metrics}{character vector. A vector of metric names to be displayed in the clock plot.
Defaults to c("Accuracy", "Sensitivity", "Specificity", "Precision", "Recall").
Valid metrics include "Accuracy", "Sensitivity", "Specificity", "Precision", "Recall",
"Pos Pred Value", "Neg Pred Value", "F1", "Prevalence", "Detection Rate",
"Detection Prevalence", "Balanced Accuracy", and any other metrics available in the
\code{confusionMatrix} object's \code{overall} or \code{byClass} slots.}

\item{plot_title}{character, optional. The title of the clock plot. Defaults to "Clock Plot of Metrics".}

\item{colors}{character vector, optional. A vector of colors to use for each method in the plot.
If NULL, a default color palette from \code{scales::hue_pal()} is used. If fewer colors are provided
than methods, colors will be recycled.}

\item{layout}{character, optional. Specifies the layout of the plots.
"single": Generates a single clock plot comparing all selected methods.
"multiple": Generates a series of clock plots, one for each selected method.
Defaults to "single".}

\item{...}{Additional arguments to be passed to the underlying plotting functions (ggplot2).}
}
\value{
ggplot object or patchwork object.
Returns a ggplot object when \code{layout = "single"}.
Returns a patchwork object (arranging multiple ggplot plots) when \code{layout = "multiple"}.
These objects can be further customized or printed.
}
\description{
Generates clock plots (also known as circular bar plots) to visualize performance metrics
derived from confusion matrices. This function supports both single and multiple plot layouts,
allowing for comparison of different methods or a detailed view of individual method performance.

\examples{
# Assuming 'all_cms' is a named list of confusionMatrix objects

# Example 1: Single clock plot with interactive method selection
clock_plot_cm(all_cms, plot_title = "Single Clock Plot Comparison")

# Example 2: Multiple clock plots, one for each method
clock_plot_cm(all_cms, layout = "multiple", plot_title = "Method-Specific Clock Plots")

# Example 3: Single clock plot for specific methods and metrics
clock_plot_cm(all_cms, methods = c("CPC2+CPAT", "TargetScan"),
               metrics = c("Accuracy", "Sensitivity", "Specificity"),
               plot_title = "Custom Single Clock Plot")

# Example 4: Multiple clock plots with custom colors
clock_plot_cm(all_cms, methods = names(all_cms)[1:3], layout = "multiple",
               plot_title = "Clock Plots with Custom Colors",
               colors = c("red", "blue", "green"))

# Example 5: Single plot with different metrics
clock_plot_cm(all_cms, metrics = c("F1", "Balanced Accuracy", "Precision", "Recall"),
               plot_title = "Clock Plot - Alternative Metrics")

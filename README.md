# lncRna
is the package for lncRNA identification i a simple way.

This package allows to carry out the lncRNA identification pipeline in a few very simple steps. In general the pipieline consist of three stages:
- extraction of known lncRNA from reference GTF
- filtering potential (unknown) lncRNA based on the features such as sequence length, exon number
- lncRNA classification based on the coding potential and the simmilarity with known nucleotide and peptide sequences (homologues in databases).
